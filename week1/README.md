# Week 1 Overview

First week of the Mission Ready Diploma focused on HTML and CSS basics.  
The goal was to understand how structure and style work together before moving into JavaScript and front-end development.

## Folder Breakdown
- day-1-intro: first HTML tags, headings, paragraphs, and links  
- day-2-html-css: linking CSS files, color, fonts, and text styling  
- day-3-css-2.0: selectors, specificity, pseudo-classes, and class vs id practice  
- day-4-5-fb-pay: building the Facebook Pay mock site using Flexbox and semantic HTML  
- day-5-form: creating form inputs, labels, textarea, and submit button  
- day-5-workshop: recap and group practice

## Reflection
This week helped me understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.  
I learned how HTML provides structure and CSS defines presentation.  
At first it felt confusing, but by the end of the week Flexbox made more sense.  
Seeing progress in the browser and GitHub commits every day helped the concepts stick.  

The Mission Ready environment makes it easier to keep learning.  
Tutors and classmates are always available, which makes the sessions more productive and enjoyable.

## Next Steps
I think next week we plan on going over CSS animations, then creating a new App with Responsive Web Design, Intro for git. and after Mission 1, head to JavaScript üôåüèø
