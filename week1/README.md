# Week 1 Overview

The first week of the Mission Ready Diploma focused on HTML and CSS basics.  
The main goal was to understand how structure and style work together before moving into JavaScript and front-end development.  
It was a big shift at first, but seeing the results live in the browser made it rewarding.

### Reflection
This week helped me build a strong foundation in front-end development.  
Learning how HTML gives structure while CSS controls presentation made everything click.  
At first, Flexbox felt confusing, but by the end of the week it made sense and became one of my favorite layout tools.  
Seeing daily progress and pushing updates to GitHub made it easier to stay consistent.

Winning the first class Kahoot was a fun way to end the week good mix of focus and friendly competition.  

The Mission Ready environment made learning easier and more enjoyable.  
The tutors and classmates were supportive, which helped me stay engaged and motivated.

### Next Steps
Next weekâ€™s plan, to explore CSS animations, improve responsive design skills, and start using Git for version control.  
After that, the focus shifts toward JavaScript.
