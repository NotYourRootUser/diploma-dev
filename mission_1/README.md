# Mission 1 Raw Project Files

This folder contains the original work for Mission 1 in the Mission Ready Diploma program.  
It is the unpolished class version, not the deployed or portfolio version.

I chose a ransomware lock screen theme because I want to connect what I am learning in front end development with my long term focus on cloud security. The idea was to show how design alone can create a strong user reaction, which is something real cyber attacks take advantage of.
