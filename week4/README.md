# Week 4 Overview

This week focused on **deeper JavaScript logic and flow**, especially how loops, functions, and DOM connections make a web page interactive.  
It was also a test of discipline — balancing code, recovery, and staying consistent after setbacks.

## Folder Breakdown

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `day1-dom` | Introduced the Document Object Model (DOM) and how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements |
| `day3-scope_es6` | Practiced variable scope, `let`, `const`, and ES6 features |
| `day4-arrayMethod` | Explored advanced array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `forEach()` |
| `day5-shoppingList` | Built a practical DOM project using event listeners and dynamic list updates |

## Reflection

This week reminded me that **growth isn’t linear**.  
Last week was about fixing my laptop; this week was about protecting focus.  
There were days where I forced productivity, only to realize discipline also needs recovery time.

Some days, the logic clicked effortlessly.  
Other days, I just showed up and trusted that showing up mattered.

Still, real progress came:
- DOM manipulation started to make sense.  
- I combined loops, arrays, and functions into real interactivity.  
- I debugged problems systematically instead of restarting entire scripts.  
- The browser finally began to feel *alive* — responsive to logic.

It wasn’t perfect, but it was **honest**.  
This week built more than skill; it built rhythm and resilience.

## Highlights

- Practiced scope isolation with `let` and `const`  
- Used ES6 features for cleaner, more readable code  
- Created a functional shopping list with DOM updates and user input  
- Strengthened debugging habits using the console  
- Learned to restore focus instead of forcing it

## Next Steps

- Deepen understanding of DOM events and dynamic updates  
- Start integrating CSS with JS for UI behavior  
- Revisit ES6 array methods with more complex data sets  
- Maintain consistent study rhythm while refining daily workflow

**Summary:**  
Week 4 was about regaining rhythm and translating JavaScript logic into real-time behavior.  
The code wasn’t always smooth, but every challenge reinforced a stronger foundation for what’s next.
