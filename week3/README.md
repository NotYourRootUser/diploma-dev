# Week 3 Overview

This week focused on JavaScript logic, learning how conditionals, loops, and functions control the flow of a program.  
It felt like the moment everything started connecting: the “why” behind what the browser does when you give it rules.  
Once I got used to testing small snippets in the console, it became easier to see how logic flows through a script.

### Folder Breakdown
- **day2-conditionals:** Practicing `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements  
- **day2-workshop:** Applying conditionals to real examples and exercises  
- **day3-object_array:** Working with arrays inside objects and looping through data  
- **day4-loop:** Exploring `for` and `while` loops for repetition and iteration  
- **day5-function_stringMethod:** Learning how functions work with parameters, returns, and string methods

### Reflection
This week pushed me to think more like a developer rather than a script follower.  
Understanding conditionals gave me control over logic, and loops made repetitive tasks make sense.  
Combining arrays, objects, and functions opened up a new level of problem-solving that felt much closer to real programming.  

Towards the end of the week my laptop stopped booting, which affected me for about half the week.  
I could still attend the live classes but couldn’t study or code properly while troubleshooting.  
It turned out I had deleted an important partition while managing disks, which broke the startup sequence.  
It was frustrating at first, but I learned a lot about recovery tools, partitions, and the importance of backups.

### Highlights
- Practiced nested conditionals and ternary operators  
- Built small functions that return values and process user input  
- Used loops to clean strings and iterate over arrays  
- Learned to debug step-by-step instead of rewriting everything  
- Started thinking about efficiency and readability in my code

### Next Steps
Next week’s focus will be learning how to connect JavaScript to the DOM (Document Object Model) to make pages interactive.  
I’ll also revisit the week’s exercises once my laptop setup is stable again and make sure I’m solid on loops and functions before moving forward.
