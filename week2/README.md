# Week 2 Overview

This week focused on getting deeper into JavaScript.  
We covered data types, strings, numbers, booleans, and how logic works behind the scenes.  
It felt like a big step up from HTML and CSS, but once the syntax started to make sense, it got more fun to experiment in the console.

### Reflection
This week I moved deeper into JavaScript, learning how variables, numbers, strings, and booleans all work together.
It felt like a big step up from HTML and CSS because now the focus is on logic and behavior instead of layout.

The labs helped me understand how data is stored and how small syntax changes can completely change the result.
Comparing equality and coercion in JavaScript to Python made things click faster, and template literals made string handling much easier.

I also got more confident using Git and GitHub. My folders are now organized and my commits are cleaner.
The Kahoot sessions made learning more fun and helped me test how much I actually remembered under pressure.

Overall, week 2 felt smoother and more structured. I can move through VS Code and DevTools faster and I‚Äôm starting to think like a programmer instead of just following tutorials.

### Presentation
The Mission 1 presentation went well.  
I built a fake ransomware-style page using HTML and CSS, which im pretty sure scared half the class but got some positive feedback.  
It was nerve-wracking at first, but once I started explaining the design choices, it became easier to talk.  
It felt good to mix creativity with cybersecurity and stand out from the usual front-end projects.

### Next Steps
Next week‚Äôs focus will be diving deeper into JavaScript logic, conditionals, and DOM interaction.  
I also plan to keep improving the ransomware project by adding small animations and a timer.
