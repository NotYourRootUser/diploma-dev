# Week 2 Presentation Reflection

I was super nervous at the start, mostly because of the audience, but it got easier once I started talking.  
My project was a fake ransomware page built with HTML and CSS. The red and black theme gave everyone a good scare and the feedback was great.  
People said they hadn’t seen a cybersecurity project like that before, which felt awesome.  

I did forget a few points because of nerves, but overall it went well.  
Three minutes felt way longer than it sounded in my head.  
Once it was over, I was just relieved and happy I didn’t forget my name.
