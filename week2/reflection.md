# Week 2 Reflection

This week I moved deeper into JavaScript, learning how variables, numbers, strings, and booleans all work together.  
It felt like a big step up from HTML and CSS because now the focus is on logic and behavior instead of layout.

The labs helped me understand how data is stored and how small syntax changes can completely change the result.  
Comparing equality and coercion in JavaScript to Python made things click faster, and template literals made string handling much easier.

I also got more confident using Git and GitHub. My folders are now organized and my commits are cleaner.  
The Kahoot sessions made learning more fun and helped me test how much I actually remembered under pressure.

Overall, week 2 felt smoother and more structured. I can move through VS Code and DevTools faster and Iâ€™m starting to think like a programmer instead of just following tutorials.
