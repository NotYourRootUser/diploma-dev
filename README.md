### Week 1 Reflection
Week 1 Reflection

Wrapped up the first week of the Diploma, starting from pure HTML/CSS structure and getting used to the front-end mindset.

Itâ€™s been a big shift from my usual Security+ focus, but itâ€™s cool seeing how logic and structure carry over between fields. Even basic things like nesting, flow, and specificity feel a bit like managing network layers, just visual instead of packets.

Had a fun Kahoot session too, ended up taking first place ðŸ˜…. Turns out all those Security+ recall drills actually helped with reaction speed and pattern recognition.

Overall, a solid start. Flexbox finally clicked, my Git commits are consistent, and Iâ€™m starting to enjoy front-end more than I expected.

## Week 2 Reflection

Settled deeper into JavaScript this week â€” working through data types, strings, and basic logic. Seeing how small syntax differences shape behavior has been interesting, especially when comparing coercion and equality in JS vs Python.

The coding labs helped build muscle memory for writing and testing quickly. Itâ€™s also been satisfying getting smoother in GitHub, tidying folders, and committing clean updates each day.

Won another class Kahoot â€” that makes two weeks in a row. The quick-fire recall feels like live debugging practice, where attention to detail and timing both matter.

Overall, week 2 felt more structured. My workflow in VS Code and DevTools is faster, I understand how strings and variables interact, and Iâ€™m starting to think more like a programmer than just a learner.
