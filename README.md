# Diploma in Digital Technology Development – Mission Ready HQ

This repo tracks my weekly work and learning progress for the Diploma in Digital Tech Development and Design.  
Each week I’ve been building skills through coding labs, group projects, and reflection work focused on real-world web development.

## About

The program covers full stack fundamentals — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and cloud basics.  
It’s helping me connect software development with my long-term goal of becoming a Cloud and AI Security Architect.  
I’m starting to see how front-end thinking, structure, and clean code link directly to secure design later on.

### Goals
- Build strong front-end foundations  
- Practice clean, readable code  
- Use Git and GitHub for daily commits  
- Reflect weekly to track growth  
- Stay consistent and curious while learning

## Weekly Reflections

- [Week 1 Reflection](./week1/reflection.md)  
  Learned HTML and CSS basics and started using Git to manage my work. It was a big shift from security studies, but I’m enjoying how structure and logic connect. Ended the week with a Kahoot win that showed recall and focus under pressure.

- [Week 2 Reflection](./week2/reflection.md)  
  Focused on JavaScript fundamentals — data types, strings, and logic. Improved my workflow in VS Code and GitHub, and built confidence writing cleaner code. Won another Kahoot, which made me realize how much faster my recall and pattern spotting have become.
