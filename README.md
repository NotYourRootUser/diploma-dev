# Mission Ready Diploma Portfolio

This repository documents my learning journey through the Mission Ready Diploma in Digital Technology Development and Design.  
Each week builds on the last, combining hands-on projects, coding practice, and personal reflections to show my progress as a developer.

## About the Diploma

The Mission Ready Diploma focuses on full stack web development.  
It covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and teamwork projects that prepare students for technical roles in the industry.  
The learning is project-based, with weekly challenges and presentations to apply new skills in real time.

## My Focus

I joined the program to strengthen my front-end development skills and connect them to my long-term goal of working in cloud and AI security.  
So far, I’ve been building a base in:
- Writing clean HTML and CSS  
- Using Git and GitHub to manage code  
- Learning JavaScript for logic and interactivity  
- Presenting and explaining technical work clearly

## Project Highlights

**Mission 1 – Ransomware Simulation Page**  
A creative HTML and CSS project designed with a cybersecurity theme.  
Used animation, color, and layout to create a tense "system error" look and feel.

## Reflection Summary

The first two weeks have built a strong foundation in both coding and workflow habits.  
I’ve learned to plan, test, and reflect on my work while staying consistent with commits and documentation.  
Each week is building more confidence to explain my projects and think like a developer.
