What does synchronous code mean in JavaScript?	Synchronous code executes one line at a time; nothing else runs until the current line finishes.
Why does synchronous code block?	Because JS is single-threaded and the call stack can only process one task at a time.
What is the main advantage of async code in a UI?	It keeps the interface responsive and prevents freezing during slow operations.
What is a Promise?	An object that represents a future value (pending → fulfilled/rejected).
What handles async tasks outside the JS thread?	The event loop + Web APIs (browser) or libuv (Node.js).
What does async do to a function?	It makes the function return a Promise automatically.
What does await do?	It pauses the async function until the Promise resolves, without blocking the rest of the program.
Does await block the entire program?	No — it only pauses the async function it’s inside.
What happens if a Promise rejects and you don’t handle it?	It causes an unhandled rejection, which can crash the app or throw errors.
What does an async function return if you don’t use await?	It immediately returns a Promise (usually pending).
Why is forgetting await dangerous?	You end up using a Promise instead of the resolved value, causing logic bugs.
What does setTimeout simulate in a fakeFetch demo?	A slow network request or API delay.
